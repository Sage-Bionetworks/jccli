## Contributions

Contributions are welcome.

### Requirements

Install these utilities:
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

### Process

Before making a commit, you should syntactically validate your code and configurations with pre-commit.

You can set up pre-commit hooks to automatically be run before every commit by running: `pre-commit install`.
Alternatively, you can manually execute the validations by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.

#### Tests

JCCLI's test suite consists of unit tests and integration tests. The integration tests depend on the environment
variable `JC_API_KEY`, which should be a Jumpcloud API key corresponding to a blank Jumpcloud instance which can be used
for testing purposes.

We use [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automate our testing. This repo's Travis configuration is set up to run
the unit test suite (in `unit_tests/`) on every pull request and push, and to run the integration test suite (in
`integration_tests/`) only on a push.

### GitHub

Contributors are requested to use the following process (in the examples, we'll suppose that a user named `john-smith`
wants to fix some typos in the documentation):

1. Make a fork of JCCLI. E.g. `Sage-Bionetworks:jccli` &rarr; `john-smith:jccli`
2. Make a branch off of `master` named after a feature or issue. E.g. `john-smith:jccli/master` &rarr;
`john-smith:jccli/fix-typo-in-docs`
3. Make commits to that branch (in this example, `john-smith:jccli/fix-typo-in-docs`). When pushed to GitHub, they
should trigger Travis to run unit tests and integration tests. For the integration tests to pass, contributors need to
make sure that the `JC_API_KEY` environmental variable in their Travis CI environment is set to a
[Jumpcloud API Key](https://jumpcloud.com/demo) &mdash;specifically, one corresponding to a "blank" Jumpcloud instance.
4. Make a pull request from the feature/issue branch on the fork (e.g. `john-smith:jccli/fix-typo-in-docs`) to
`Sage-Bionetworks:jccli/master`.
5. Wait for maintainers to review code and approve the pull request.

Maintainers should use the following process for reviewing and approving outside pull requests:

1. Examine proposed changes on GitHub. Pay special attention to hidden environment variables (as of write time,
`JC_API_KEY`) and make sure nothing in the changes could expose them or use them for unintended purposes. *If in doubt,
DO NOT proceed to the next step*.
2. Incorporate the changes into a new branch in our repo, e.g. create a branch `Sage-Bionetworks:jccli/fix-typo-in-docs`
and manually pull in the changes from `john-smith:jccli/fix-typo-in-docs`. Make a new tracking remote branch (i.e. `git
push --set-upstream origin fix-typo-in-docs`, or whatever the name of your remote is, instead of `origin`) and push to
it in order to trigger a Travis CI build. Make sure that the `integration-test` job ran and passed successfully.
3. Approve/merge the pull request and delete the feature branch made for testing purposes
(`Sage-Bionetworks:jccli/fix-types-in-docs`, in the example).

## Versioning
We try to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) as much as possble.
We use [bump2version](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/) to help automate
versioning of this project.

To manually bump the version:
```
bumpversion patch --config-file setup.cfg
```

## Releasing

We have setup our CI to automate a release of this app.  To kick off the process just create
a tag (i.e v1.0.0) and push to the repo.  It is important to have the `v` in the tag and
the tag must be the same number as the current version.  Our CI will do the work of publishing
the app to pypi and then bumping to the next version for development.
